# Fisheries Assessment Database (.net)

This is the c# version of FAD3 database software for fisheries stock assessment. All future developments of FAD3 will take place here. The VB6 version will only have bug maintenance fixes. New reports will also be continued to be develop in the VB6 version.

You can download the latest version of the database installer here at the [FAD releases page](https://github.com/raffyMartinez/faddotnet/releases). The installer files are packed in one zipped file. You have to unzip the file before you can install FAD into a computer.

Fisheries Assessment Database allows visualization of fishing effort, species distribution, and other maps. Make sure to install the free and awesome [MapWindows mapping component](https://github.com/raffyMartinez/fad3_vb6/blob/master/FAD3setup_3.0.211.exe) to enable mapping. The software will stil work if the mapping component is not installed but you will miss out a lot of cool mapping stuff!

Visit their [github page](https://github.com/MapWindow) to know more about MapWindows mapping software.

What are some of the features of  FAD?
1. Make it easy to encode voluminous fishery assessment data at the same time avoiding mistakes.
2. Map out fishing grounds of fish landings. Ensure that fishing grounds are within the target area and is not found inland.
3. Maintain consistency in spelling of fishing gears, catch names, catch local names
4. Provide links to authoritative websites for all species names.
5. Inventory of fishers, fishing vessels, and gears in a target area
6. Database of local names and equivalent species names in different languages/dialects. 
7. Import and export datasets using excel, text, and xml formats.
8. Map properties such as chlorophyll distribution
