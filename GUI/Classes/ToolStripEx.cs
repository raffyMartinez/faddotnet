    // The ToolStrip and MenuStrip classes are extended to allow customization of the user interface
    //
    // The following new boolean properties are exposed in the designer:
    //
    // ClickThrough - Allow the first click to activate the control, even when the containing form is not active
    // SupressHighlighting - Suppress the mouseover highlighting of the control when the containing form is not active
    //
    // The ideas behind this were borrowed from two items found on the Internet:
    //
    // Rick Brewster shows how to implement ClickThrough on his blog at:
    //   http://blogs.msdn.com/rickbrew/
    //
    // JasonD suggests the method to suppress the highlighting on at forum at:
